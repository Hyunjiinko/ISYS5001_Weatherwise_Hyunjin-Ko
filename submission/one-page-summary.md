# One-Page Summary – WeatherWise

The **WeatherWise** project is a Python-based weather advisor application that combines API integration, data visualisation, and AI-assisted development.  
It retrieves real-time weather data using the wttr.in API and presents both graphical and natural language responses for user-specified locations.  
The system applies modular programming principles, with separate functions for data retrieval, visualisation, natural language processing, and user interaction.  
To improve performance and user experience, I implemented caching, multi-city comparison, and an informative “No rain expected” feature for empty datasets.  
AI tools such as ChatGPT supported my learning by helping me reason through design choices, test edge cases, and refine code structure without providing direct answers.  
This project brought together everything I learned about APIs, user interface design, and intentional AI prompting, resulting in a fully functional and easy-to-use weather advisory system.
