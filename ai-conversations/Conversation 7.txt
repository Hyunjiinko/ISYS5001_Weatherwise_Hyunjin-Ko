Title: User Interface Design – Switching from ipywidgets to pyinputplus
Date: 2 October 2025

Me:
I’m trying to use ipywidgets to make an interactive menu for my WeatherWise project, but it keeps giving me “invalid notebook metadata” errors when I save or reopen in Google Colab.
Is there a better way to handle user input without causing these issues?

AI:
Explained that ipywidgets sometimes stores UI state data in notebook metadata, which Colab doesn’t always handle well.
Suggested using a simple text-based interface with pyinputplus instead.
Described how pyinputplus offers numbered menus, input validation, and is more compatible with Colab and JupyterHub.

---
Me:
So if I use pyinputplus, I can still have a menu like “Check Weather / View Visualisation / Exit” without widgets?

AI:
Exactly.
Showed an example using:
    choice = pyip.inputMenu(["Check Weather","View Visualisation","Exit"], numbered=True)
to replicate the same functionality through the console.

Me:
I replaced my ipywidgets code with your pyinputplus version, and it runs perfectly.
No more errors when saving or re-opening the notebook.
It also feels simpler to test since it doesn’t depend on browser rendering.

AI:
Great call.
That’s why many developers prefer text-based menus in environments where notebook metadata can break.
It keeps your UI portable and stable across systems.

---
Me:
So I’ll keep pyinputplus as my final UI tool—it’s consistent and user-friendly enough for this project.

AI:
Good decision.
It demonstrates thoughtful tool selection and shows that you can balance advanced features with reliability.

---
Reflection:
This conversation shows intentional prompting in system design.
I used AI to compare two interface methods, evaluated real runtime issues, and chose the one that best fits my environment.
By switching to pyinputplus, I avoided metadata corruption errors and ensured the app would work reliably for assessment.
This demonstrates analytical thinking and evidence-based decision-making rather than just copying code.
