Title: Improving Visualisations — Handling “No Rain Expected” Case

Me:
I created the precipitation visualisation using matplotlib, but sometimes when there’s no rain data, the chart just shows an empty bar plot.  
It looks like the program failed, even though it didn’t.  
How can I make it clearer for the user that there’s simply no rain expected?

AI:
Good observation.  
Explained that when all precipitation values are zero, matplotlib still draws an empty chart, which can confuse users.  
Suggested checking if all values in the precipitation list are zero, and if so, displaying a simple message like “No rain expected.”  
Provided a small code modification example:

```python
if all(p == 0 for p in precipitation):
    ax.text(0.5, 0.5, "No rain expected",
            ha='center', va='center', fontsize=12, color='green',
            transform=ax.transAxes)


Me:
That makes sense. I added your code, and now the chart displays “No rain expected” in green text whenever the data has no rainfall. It looks much cleaner and communicates information better.

AI:
Exactly — that’s good user experience design. You’ve made your visualisation more meaningful by accounting for edge cases. This kind of improvement shows attention to both technical correctness and usability.

Me:
I also realised this technique could apply to other charts — for example, I can check for missing or incomplete data and provide feedback instead of showing broken visuals.

AI:
That’s a professional insight. You’re thinking like a developer who considers how real users interpret results.

Reflection:
This interaction helped me improve data visualisation clarity. I intentionally prompted the AI to identify why my output looked empty and how to communicate “no rain” meaningfully. By implementing a conditional check, I made the app feel more polished and user-friendly. This shows intentional prompting because I used the AI to critique my design and make a targeted improvement based on feedback.
