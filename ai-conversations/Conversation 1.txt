Title: Choosing the Right Weather API (wttr.in vs OpenWeatherMap)

Me:
What’s the difference between using wttr.in and OpenWeatherMap API for my WeatherWise project?  
Which one is easier for me as a beginner, and do I need an API key?

AI:
Explained that wttr.in requires no API key and is ideal for simple JSON weather retrieval,  
while OpenWeatherMap needs registration, API key management, and more complex parsing.  
Suggested using wttr.in to focus on Python logic instead of API authentication.

Me:
So if I use wttr.in, do I still need to include the API key section from the template?  
It had a line that asked me to connect to Ollama and enter an API key.

AI:
No. The Ollama key is for the optional “hands-on-ai” extension only.  
You can safely remove or comment out that block because it’s unrelated to weather data.  
wttr.in already provides public access via HTTPS with no key needed.

Me:
Got it. So I’ll simplify my setup and focus on data retrieval first.

AI:
Good plan. That will keep your environment clean and prevent API-key errors.  
You can always add a more advanced API later if you want extra credit.

Reflection:
This conversation helped me understand the differences between free public APIs and authenticated APIs.  
I intentionally chose wttr.in to reduce setup complexity and focus on Python programming skills.  
Removing the unnecessary Ollama section also kept my notebook stable and avoided metadata errors.
