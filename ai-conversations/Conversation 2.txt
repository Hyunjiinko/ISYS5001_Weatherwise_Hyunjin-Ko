Title: Fetching Weather Data and Fixing Forecast Days Error  
Date: 30 September 2025

Me:
I wrote this code to get weather data, but even when I set `forecast_days=5`, it still only gives me 3 days of results.  
Why is that happening?

AI:
Explained that the wttr.in API only provides a 3-day forecast by default, regardless of what number you pass to `forecast_days`.  
The parameter in your function only controls how many days from the returned data you *choose* to display, not how many are retrieved.  
Suggested slicing the JSON data with `data["weather"][:forecast_days]` but noted that it will still show a maximum of 3 days.

Me:
Oh, so it’s not my code’s problem — the API itself limits it to 3 days?  

AI:
Exactly. wttr.in doesn’t allow you to change the forecast length through the URL.  
If you need 5 or more days, you’d have to use a different API like OpenWeatherMap.  
For now, you can just keep the `forecast_days` parameter so your code structure stays flexible in the future.

Me:
That makes sense. I’ll leave `forecast_days=5` for now, but I understand it will only return 3.  
It’s good to know that my code wasn’t wrong — it’s just a limitation of the data source.

AI:
Yes, that’s the right understanding. You handled this like a developer — by questioning the API response instead of just changing code blindly.

Reflection:
This conversation helped me realize that not all bugs are code-related — sometimes they’re caused by API design limits.  
I learned to verify data sources before debugging logic, and I kept my code flexible by keeping the `forecast_days` argument in case I switch APIs later.  
This shows intentional prompting because I used AI to understand the *reason behind the issue*, not just to fix syntax.
